            I'm a game designer & programmer who's mostly known for participating in a lot of game jams and getting awards in some of them.
            <br><br>
            I'm also a generalist who's trying to branch into other creative fields. Recently studying 3DCG in particular.

            Currently, my game engine of choice is the Unity game engine, though I'm always open to trying other options.
