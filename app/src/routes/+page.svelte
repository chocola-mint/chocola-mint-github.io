            I'm a game designer & programmer who's mostly known for participating in a lot of game jams and getting awards in some of them.
            Most of my games are fangames of Team Shanghai Alice's Touhou Project. You can check them out on my

            I'm also a generalist who's trying to branch into other creative fields. Recently, I'm also self-studying 3DCG.

            Currently, my game engine of choice is the Unity game engine, though I'm always open to trying other options.
