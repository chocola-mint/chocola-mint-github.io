            I'm a game designer & programmer who's mostly known for participating in a lot of game jams and getting awards in some of them.
            Most of my games are fangames of Team Shanghai Alice's Touhou Project. You can check them out on my 
            <OpenInNewTab href="https://chocola-mint.itch.io">Itch</OpenInNewTab> page. I'm fluent in English, and good enough in Japanese to prepare online presentations.
            <br><br>
            I'm also a generalist who's trying to branch into other creative fields, such as <OpenInNewTab href="https://www.pixiv.net/users/35917669">digital illustrations</OpenInNewTab>. Recently, I'm also self-studying 3DCG.
            <br><br>
            Currently, my game engines of choice are Unity and Godot, though I'm always open to trying other options.
            <br><br>
