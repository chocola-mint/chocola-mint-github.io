    Submission to <OpenInNewTab href="https://unityroom.com/unity1weeks/60">unity1week Game Jam お題「1ボタン」</OpenInNewTab>.
    <br><br>
    A hyper-casual game where you play as a tiny inventor "Hakase-chan", who has to keep coming up new weapons to keep the <i>Kaiju</i> from taking over her toy island.
    <br>
    I worked with creators from the English-speaking Touhou fan community for this game. I was the designer and programmer.
    <br>
    The game placed 8th overall, and managed to get 1st in the Fun category, out of nearly 400 entries. (Results at the time of ranking announcements)

    Submission to <OpenInNewTab href="https://unityroom.com/unity1weeks/59">unity1week Game Jam お題「ふる」</OpenInNewTab>.
    <br><br>
    An action platformer where you play as a robot girl with an umbrella, fighting against a gigantic titan that controls the weather.
    It featured textless tutorials and a very cinematic boss fight.
    <br>
    This is a collaboration between me and Japanese creators (a 2D artist and a composer) whom I met through the <i>unity1week TeamUp!!</i> program. I was the programmer here.
    <br>
    It placed 14th on average out of nearly 400 entries, and was a very fun experience for me overall.

    Submission to Touhou Fan Game Jam 10.
    <br><br>
    When air hockey meets shooters. Given the short timeframe (4 days), it was quite a complete project. 
    Notably, it got 1st in Visuals and Music, and 3rd in Story and Concept. I was the writer, designer, and programmer.

    title="Sorting Battle (2022 Fall)"
    projectPage="https://chocola-mint.itch.io/sorting-battle">
    Final project for an undergraduate-level Machine Learning course.
    <br><br>
    This project is special in that it uses Unity's low-level Barracuda API to run an ONNX model trained using an external Python environment.
    The Python environment is built in a way that meets the same specs as the Unity application. To this end, unit testing is used extensively.

    Submission to Touhou Pride Game Jam 4.
    <br><br>
    Unlike most of the games I've been involved with, this one's concept came mostly from the artist instead.
    I handled the engine-side design and programming.
